# Marketing-Channel-Analysis-Superstore-Sales.
SuperStore, a global retailer of office supplies, furniture, and technology, seeks to leverage its extensive transactional data to address operational and marketing inefficiencies. Despite collecting customer, geographic, product, and financial metrics, the company struggles to identify trends for informed decision-making. 

As the data analyst, my role involves analyzing this dataset to uncover customer behavior patterns, optimize marketing strategies, and improve logistics. Key stakeholders—including marketing, sales, executives, and logistics teams—will use these insights to drive growth, enhance customer retention, and streamline operations.
